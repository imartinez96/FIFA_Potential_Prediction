# FIFA Player Potential Prediction

### Problem Statement

Soccer has a huge fanbase all over the world. Every year, after the end of season, the transfer window allows different clubs to buy, sell or loan players to/from other clubs. Also, the betting agencies start placing their bets on whether a player will complete his rumored transfer to the club in picture. Before spending millions on a player, the clubs analyze the player’s past performance and his future potential to make sure if he will be worth the hassle or not. EA Sports’ FIFA 19 is the latest version of their football simulation game. FIFA provides ratings of the players based on the performance in the past season, and his potential based on attributes like passing accuracy, dribbling, crossing, finishing, height, weight, etc. Different clubs would certainly want to predict the potential of the player before finalizing a deal to get him to their club.

The aim of this project is to be able to predict the Potential score of a player based on the data present in the dataset. We also want to inspect what attributes factor into determining a soccer players Potential score. The dataset contains the details of players, their nationality, and other attributes such as dribbling, acceleration, stamina, shot accuracy, etc.
